# class holds attributes and methods(actions)
# Methods are functions defined inside body of a class. methods define behavior of objects.  
# Example - Emp is a class, its attributes are Name & Age and its Methods are Perform job and Give presentation
# Example - Car is a class, its objects are Ford, GM , Tesla
# Inheritance is creating a new class that uses all properties, its called derived class. Human is interence class, Persona is derived class
